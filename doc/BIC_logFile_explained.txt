//                 how many segments that match the marker were found
//                                      after thresholding, did the algorithm manage to place the fused segment into the output image?
//                                       secured means - placing went easy, no collision/overlap was discovered
TRA marker: 4 , images matching: 1 , secured for now
TRA marker: 3 , images matching: 1 , secured for now
TRA marker: 2 , images matching: 1 , secured for now
TRA marker: 1 , images matching: 1 , secured for now
//her's the info from the post-processing part, for marker four, the fused segment was composed of 7 connected components... and only the largest one was kept
CCA for marker 4: choosing one from 7 components
CCA for marker 4: chosen component no. 1 which constitutes 0.9996036 % of the original size

//here the job is done, just reports on how things went:
//reports sizes of the overlapping segments, ideally you want to see everything in the 0-9% category (0% means no overlap)
reporting colliding markers:
HIST: 0 %- 9 % collision area happened 4 times
HIST: 10 %- 19 % collision area happened 0 times
HIST: 20 %- 29 % collision area happened 0 times
HIST: 30 %- 39 % collision area happened 0 times
HIST: 40 %- 49 % collision area happened 0 times

HIST: 80 %- 89 % collision area happened 0 times
HIST: 90 %- 99 % collision area happened 0 times
HIST: 100 %- 100 % collision area happened 0 times

//here's info w.r.t. to input TRA markers, for how many no segment was created, how many created segments were removed because of touching boundary,
//                                             how were removed due to severe (>10%) collision, and how many were created in the end (how many we should find in the output image)
not found markers    = 0 = 0.0 %
markers at boundary  = 0 = 0.0 %
markers in collision = 0 = 0.0 %
secured markers      = 4 = 100.0 %
//this log says, the fusion/re-labeling went very well... 100% of TRA markers were "replaced" with some fused/output segment
